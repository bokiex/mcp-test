## Implementation Details

### Date: 2025-07-30
- Created MCP (Multi-Cloud Platform) for Pokemon API integration
- Implemented TypeScript-based architecture with Express.js
- Key components:
  - Config: Singleton pattern for configuration management
  - Models: TypeScript interfaces for Pokemon data
  - Services: Pokemon service with API integration
  - Main: Express server with REST endpoints

### Technical Decisions
- Chose TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- Implemented singleton pattern for configuration management
- Used axios for HTTP requests due to its promise-based API
- Designed RESTful API endpoints for Pokemon data retrieval

### API Integration
- Base URL: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/
- Implemented error handling for:
  - Input validation
  - API errors (404, timeouts)
  - Data transformation errors

### Testing
- Added comprehensive unit tests for Pokemon service
- Mocked axios for testing API integration
- Covered error scenarios and success cases

### Documentation
- Created architecture.md with system overview
- Created implementation.md with detailed component explanations
- Created todo.md with remaining tasks

### Future Improvements
- Add caching layer for API responses
- Implement rate limiting middleware
- Add more Pokemon-related endpoints (types, moves, species)
- Add authentication for API access
- Implement request logging
